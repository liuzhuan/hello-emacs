# 使用 Org Mode

> 以下笔记来自 Emacs 自带的帮助文档，通过 `C-h i` 进入

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.

All of Org's features are achieved with strictly plain text files, the most portable and future-proof file format.

Recent Emacs distributions include a packaging system which lets you install Elisp libraries. You can install Org with `M-x package-install<RET>org`.

Org mode buffers need font-lock to be turned on.

Suggested Four Org Commands bindings

1. `(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link')`
2. `(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda')`
3. `(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture')`
4. `(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-switchb')`
